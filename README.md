# The role of Google advertisements in the 2019 Lok Sabha election
- A very small number of political parties used Google advertisements to gain voter support.
- BJP spent the most and had the highest number of advertisements, but regional parties such as the TDP and YSRCP had more views for their advertisements.
- Parties seldom utilized strategies such as targeting to personalize advertisements to specific geographic, gender or age groups.

Few political parties in India leverage online advertising in their election campaigns. Political advertising through social media and other online platforms can be inexpensive and more effective than traditional mediums in targeting, soliciting funds, and tracking ad efficiency. However, less than ten political parties had a significant number of advertisements on Google in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

These estimates are computed from transparency data published by Google bi-annually, “in an effort to increase transparency around political advertising on its platforms”. 

## Spending on Google advertisements
BJP recorded the highest spending on Google advertisements for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. 83% of the 11,928 political advertisements that Google ran were in support of the party, which contributed to 45% of Google’s total revenue from political advertisements between February and May 2019.  This is four times the amount that the Indian National Congress party spent on Google advertisements. In fact, political parties allied with the NDA spent 75% more than parties allied with the UPA. 
 
## Ad visibility
Ad visibility is measured by the number of “Impressions” or views that an advertisement receives on the internet. The Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress party garnered the most impressions with 20-30% of their advertisements being viewed by over 10 lakh people. Most other parties received fewer than 10 lakh views but more than 10,000 views, except for the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party whose ads largely recorded impressions less than 10,000. 

Ad visibility is not solely driven by spending. It is also a function of the prevalence of audiences that the ad was targeted to, the number of days an advertisement ran for, and the number of online searches for the party or candidate. Additionally, different parties might adopt different strategies. The BJP for example, had more advertisements with lower visibility whereas the Telugu Desam Party had fewer advertisements with greater visibility. 

## Targeting
The adverse consequences of unregulated micro-targeting on social media platforms came into light after the 2014 US Presidential elections and subsequently led to Twitter banning political advertisements, and Google restricting targeting parameters for political advertisements. 

In India, Google allows political advertisements to be targeted based on geographic location (except radius), age and gender. However, data shows that only 30% of all political advertisements for the 2019 Lok Sabha election were targeted. 

Targeting was mainly used by regional parties such as the AIADMK, Trinamool Congress and Telugu Desam Party to cater to specific geographic regions.

BJP targeted 12% of its advertisements based on geography, and less than 1% on age and gender. The Congress party targeted a slightly higher percentage of their advertisements, partly because there were more advertisements led by individual candidates for their respective constituencies as opposed to blanket advertisements for the prime ministerial candidate. 24% of the party’s advertisements were targeted to specific geographical locations, and 20% to specific age and gender demographics.

## Policy violations
Political advertisements “featuring or run by a political party, a political candidate or current member of the Lok Sabha” are subject to Google’s ad policy and non-compliance is addressed by removal.

The ad policy requires political parties, individuals and organizations advertising to be verified, and their advertisements to include sponsor disclosures and be pre-certified by the Election Commission of India as mandated by the constitutional authority itself. Additionally, advertisers are responsible for complying with local laws. An advertisement can be removed for violating any of these conditions. 

The data shows that 389 advertisements were removed during the campaign of which the Congress party had the highest number of violations. The specific clauses violated by these advertisements are however, not reported. 

## Data source:
- Google transparency data: https://transparencyreport.Google.com/political-ads/home?hl=en

## Notes on methodology:
- As Google’s dataset is organized by advertiser and not political party, advertisers were manually mapped to political parties in cases where the advertisement was posted by an agency and not a political party or individual candidate. This was done by looking up the advertisements manually on the Google transparency data portal.
